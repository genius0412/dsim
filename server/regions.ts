/**
 * Region topology for multi-region matchmaking (one Fly app, one machine per
 * region). This module is server infra — NOT `src/sim` — so wall-clock and plain
 * data are fine here; nothing in it feeds the deterministic step().
 *
 * The matchmaker never pings regions itself. Each client reports its `homeRegion`
 * (the region Fly's Anycast routed it to, read from the `/health` `x-region`
 * header) plus one measured `accessMs` (RTT to that home machine). We estimate the
 * client's latency to any OTHER region as `accessMs + INTER_REGION_MS[home][r]`,
 * using a static inter-region RTT matrix. The fair host for a group is the region
 * that MINIMISES the worst player's latency (minimax) — i.e. roughly "in the
 * middle", so nobody eats the whole cross-region penalty.
