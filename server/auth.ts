/**
 * Server-side Neon Auth (Better Auth) session verification. The client sends the
 * JWT from `getAuthToken()` on `join`; we verify its signature against Neon Auth's
 * JWKS and read the subject as the user id. SECURE BY DEFAULT: a missing/invalid
 * token ⇒ null ⇒ the run is anonymous (dropped by persistMatch), never trusted.
 *
 * Config (server env — set as Fly secrets, NOT VITE_):
 *   NEON_AUTH_URL   the same base as the client's VITE_NEON_AUTH_URL
 *   NEON_AUTH_JWKS_URL  (optional) override the JWKS endpoint if Neon's differs
 *     from the Better Auth default `${NEON_AUTH_URL}/jwks`.
 *
 * NOTE (beta): the exact JWKS path + claim names should be confirmed against a
 * live token once (log a decoded token). Until the JWKS URL resolves, verify()
 * returns null and everything degrades to anonymous — no crash, no bad writes.
