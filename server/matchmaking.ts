/**
 * Region-aware ranked matchmaking. Runs on the DESIGNATED matchmaker machine (all
 * `?mm=1` connections are fly-replayed here), so it holds ONE global queue per
 * bucket across every region. Pairing is region-local first and widens over time:
 *
 *  - Each entry reports `homeRegion` + `accessMs`; the matchmaker estimates every
 *    player's latency to every region (`bestHost`) and hosts a match on the fair
 *    MIDPOINT region (minimax).
 *  - A pairing is only allowed once its cross-region `spread` fits under every
 *    member's SEARCH RADIUS, which starts at 0 (same region only) and widens with
 *    wait time / an explicit `expandSearch`. So you get a local match if one is
 *    available soon, and a farther one only after waiting.
 *
 * On a match the matchmaker STAGES the roster (Postgres `pending_matches`) and sends
 * `matchAssigned`; the clients reconnect to the host region, which builds the real
 * match. When the DB is off (local dev) it falls back to hosting the match right
 * here (`localStart`), which only works for same-machine players — fine for dev.
 */

/**
 * Search-radius schedule, in CROSS-REGION ms (not absolute ping — a player's own
 * access latency never counts against the gate, so a bad local link can't block a
 * local match).
 *
 * TUNED FOR A SMALL POOL, which is the pool this game actually has. The radius is
 * not a quality mechanism — `findMatch` picks the CLOSEST eligible opponent, so a
 * local match is taken whenever a local match exists, at any radius. All the
 * radius decides is HOW LONG YOU WAIT FOR A BETTER ONE TO SHOW UP. On a pool of
 * two or three people that better one is not coming, and the old schedule (0ms
 * for the first 8s, +60ms per 8s) charged everyone for it: 16 seconds before two
 * players on opposite US coasts were even allowed to meet, 40 before the queue
 * went global. With a handful of players online that wait WAS the matchmaking
 * time.
 *
 * So: open at 90ms, which already covers every same-continent pair (iad↔lhr 76,
 * iad↔sjc 85) — those are good matches, and there is nothing to gain by making
 * them wait. Then reach worldwide in 6 seconds instead of 40.

 * front-loaded — a stable sort by descending unit size does it: a 2v2 with one
 * party becomes [P, P, S, S], red = the party.
 *
 * The 1v1 case looks like it should be the exception and isn't. A `rated1v1`
 * party of two lands at indices 0 and 1 with half = 1, so it splits ACROSS the
 * alliances — which is exactly right, because in that format the party is the two
 * opponents, not two teammates. Same rule, both meanings.
