 *    `records.replay_id`. Cascading the records first would orphan the replay
 *    rows permanently, so they are collected and deleted BEFORE the profile goes.
 *  - `elo_history` deliberately has no foreign key (it is a per-season snapshot
 *    that must survive a season roll), so it needs its own delete.
 *  - `kofi_payments.claimed_by` is `on delete set null`, which is correct — the
