/**
 * Analytics — the minimum needed to tell whether any of this monetization works.
 *
 * Without it there is no way to answer the only questions that matter after
 * launch: does anyone reach the Support page, does anyone click through to Ko-fi,
 * does a claim ever succeed, and do the ad columns shorten sessions. Shipping
 * ads and a paid tier with no measurement means tuning them by vibes.
 *
 * WHY VERCEL ANALYTICS and not something hand-rolled: the site already deploys
 * on Vercel, it is cookieless and stores no personal data (so it needs no consent
 * banner and adds nothing to the privacy policy's third-party list beyond the
 * host we already name), and the alternative — a bespoke events table on the game
 * server — would mean building session attribution, bot filtering, and a
 * dashboard, all of which are solved problems.
 *
 * IT IS ALSO THE SPONSOR REPORT. The presenting sponsor is owed monthly numbers —
 * clicks, sessions, new players — and they are what the deal renews on. Those come
 * from the `sponsor_*` / `player_joined` events below plus Vercel's own session
 * counts, i.e. from the measurement that already exists, rather than from a bespoke
 * events table that would have to be built, deployed, and then trusted. See
 * `docs/sponsor.md` for which filter produces which line of the report.
 *
 * PRIVACY RULE FOR EVERY EVENT BELOW: names and ids never leave the app. The
 * properties here are counts and enum-ish strings, never a user id, username,
 * email, or Ko-fi transaction id. An analytics payload is the easiest place in a
 * codebase to leak personal data by accident, so the rule is "no identifiers",
 * not "be careful".
