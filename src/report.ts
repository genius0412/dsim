/**
 * PLAYER REPORTS — the shared vocabulary, used by the client picker, the server validator
 * and the moderation panel, so the three can never disagree about what a category means.
 *
 * THE CATEGORIES COME FROM THIS GAME, not from a generic list. DSIM has no chat, no voice
 * and no direct messaging, so "abusive messages" is not a thing that can happen here and
 * offering it would collect reports nobody can act on. The surfaces a player can actually
 * misuse are:
 *
 *   - the MATCH itself (throwing, sitting out, abandoning)
 *   - the CLIENT (the sim is server-authoritative, but the robot SPEC is client-supplied
 *     and `coerceSpec` is the only thing standing between the wire and the world)
 *   - the free TEXT they own: display name, team name, robot name — the entire surface for
 *     harassment in a game with no chat, and the reason `name` is a first-class category
 *     rather than being folded into "other"
 *
 * `dodging` overlaps the automatic dodge penalty on purpose. The automatic one charges
 * rating for a single abandoned pairing; a report is how a HUMAN flags a pattern the
 * escalation window is too short to catch (someone dodging twice a day, every day).
