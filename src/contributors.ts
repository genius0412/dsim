/**
 * The Contributors page's roster.
 *
 * This is HAND-MAINTAINED, and deliberately so: none of it is derivable from the
 * account system. Auth is Neon Auth only — there is no Discord OAuth anywhere in
 * this codebase, so a Discord avatar or profile link can't be looked up, and a
 * contributor's game account (if they even have one) isn't linked to their GitHub
 * handle either. Keep it in step with `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, which is the CLA record;
 * this file is only what the page renders.
 *
 * EVERY field except `fallbackName` is optional, and the card degrades cleanly
 * without each one — a contributor with no game account, no Discord, or no avatar
 * still renders. That matters because the page must also work when the game server
 * is unreachable (a cold Fly machine, or a Vercel preview with no
 * `VITE_GAME_SERVER_URL`), where NO live handle resolves for anyone.
 */

 * correctly with the fields still missing, so this list can be completed one person
 * at a time without breaking the page.
