/**
 * Chain Reaction BEAMS — four 1"-tall tubes of difficult terrain around the center.
 *
 * Crossing model (bespoke, PER-WHEEL, after the Rapier robot solve):
 *  • The ONLY hard gate is CLEARANCE: `groundClearance ≥ CHAIN_BEAM_HEIGHT`. If the
 *    frame can't clear the beam it's blocked like a wall (it can still drive
 *    ALONGSIDE — only the across-beam motion stops). Given clearance, EVERY drivetrain
 *    can cross — nothing is hard-blocked by wheel type.
 *  • The drag is decided WHEEL-BY-WHEEL, not by the chassis outline. A beam only bites
 *    while one of the robot's FOUR wheels is up on the 1" ridge (`wheelsOnBeam`), so a
 *    robot STRADDLING a beam (tube under the belly, all wheels on the floor) rolls free,
 *    and a straight crossing is felt as TWO bumps — front axle, then rear. Lifted wheels
 *    lose traction (`grounded = (4 − up)/4`), so more wheels on the ridge = harder, and
 *    all four up (high-centered) = barely any grip.
 *  • A mecanum STRAFING sideways into a beam does not climb it at all — its 45° rollers can't
 *    roll up a 1" tube, so it hits the near face like a CURB and stops (`beamStrafeBlock`, a
 *    post-solve positional clamp — the wheel rests at the face, the low frame overhangs, NO
 *    ooze onto the top). That path replaces the climbing drag whenever the crossing is strafe-
 *    dominant (`beamForwardness < CHAIN_BEAM_STRAFE_BLOCK_FWD`); a straighter push climbs over
 *    via the drag above. Mecanum ONLY — tank can't strafe, a swerve steers its pods into the
 *    travel direction, and an x-drive is 4-fold symmetric. So a mecanum must POINT AT a beam.
 *  • The clearance ↔ CoG tradeoff: more clearance eases beam crossing but raises the
 *    center of gravity ⇒ `cogFactor` scales down ALL drive authority (sluggish, tippy).
 *
 * The beams form the +x/−x/+y/−y AXES: each is 56" long, running IN from a field wall to
 * `INNER` (16" from centre). `axis` is a beam's NORMAL (the direction you cross it).
