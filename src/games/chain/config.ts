/**
 * Chain Reaction (presented by goBILDA) — field + element constants.
 *
 * The 2026 Unofficial-FTC CAD-competition game. Values from the competition manual
 * (`cm.pdf` — its page streams are corrupt/unrenderable, so the numbers here come
 * from the manual PAGES the user supplied as images + explicit dimensions). mm are
 * converted to the sim's INCH world via `mm()` (÷25.4).
 *
 * Field: standard FTC 12'×12' (144") soft-tile field, origin at center, +x =
 * audience right, +y away from the audience. RED alliance = LEFT (columns A–C, from
 * the audience), BLUE = RIGHT (columns D–F).
 *
 * ── Terminology (manual §2–4) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  • ACCELERATOR — the alliance goal: launch PARTICLES into it (1 pt each). Sits
 *    OUTSIDE each alliance's side wall (red left, blue right).
 *  • PARTICLE — a 3"-OD wiffle ball (300 of them). Launchable from ANYWHERE.
 *
 * ── Automation (manual §3.1) — particles are NEVER consumed ─────────────────
 *  The ACCELERATOR has an auto-score + REJECT system: a launched particle is
 *  counted (scores) then LAUNCHED BACK onto the field. Pre-match it distributes all
 *  300 particles across the field (randomization); during teleop it keeps
 *  re-distributing scored particles back out. So the field always holds ~300
 *  particles. The HOOK has its own auto-score confirming a Catalyst is seated and
 *  applying the +1 pt/particle bonus. (Implement this recycle loop when particles
 *  land — a particle entering the accelerator scores + respawns onto the field.)
 *  • CATALYST — a 6"-OD purple ring (4 of them). Placed on a HOOK ⇒ +1 pt/particle.
 *  • HOOK — on the accelerator wall (this file's `CHAIN_HOOK_Y`); holds a Catalyst.
 *  • RING STAND — a 22.5" vertical steel pole at the field corners; robots ASCEND
 *    (endgame, 100 pt) / DESCEND (auto, 100 pt) it.
 *  • LAB AREA — each alliance's start/park zone (leave 5 pt auto / park 5 pt endgame).
 *  • PARTICLE ZONE — the center diamond of white tape (neutral, unprotected).
 *
 * FULLY PLAYABLE + SCORED: particles (all 300, with pre-match randomization and the
 * accelerator score/recycle loop), the three shooter archetypes, catalysts/hooks,
 * ring-stand ascend/descend, Lab park, beam terrain, and the G05/G06 penalties are all
 * implemented. What is still OUTSTANDING is manual PRECISION, not features: a few
 * field-zone coordinates (Ring-Stand inset, Lab-Area size, Particle-Zone placement) were
 * derived from description rather than a figure — every one of those is FLAGGED `APPROX`
 * below. Refine those constants rather than inventing new ones.

 * was a shape nobody would build for this game. It also made the mount trade-offs incoherent:
 * a build could dodge a mount's cost by shrinking instead of by giving something up.
 *
 * Charging the cube (the previous model) capped a front+back sweeper at 12" long and a side
 * sweeper at 12" wide, which is exactly what made a 15" floor impossible for 11 of the 12
 * intake × mount combinations.

 * taste. G04 wants the robot completely inside its 24" Lab Area, whose outer corner is
 * occupied by the solid 6" Ring-Stand assembly; escaping the post means retreating inward on
 * one axis, which only leaves room while the half-extent (plus clearance) stays under 9".
 * That is a 17" chassis. An 18" one has NO legal start pose at any heading in any corner, so
 * offering it would be offering a robot you can build and never field.
 *
 * The strict reading is "at least ONE axis under 17" — an 18×15 robot can retreat along its
 * short axis and does fit. Both sliders are capped at 17 anyway: a coupled 2D constraint
 * cannot be expressed in two independent sliders without one of them silently moving the
 * other, and giving up the long-thin corner case is a much smaller cost than that.

 * whether they can throw:
 *  • ARM — the reach specialist. A long arm out one edge: the biggest working radius, so it
 *    both grabs and seats from further back than anything else. Pays for it by having to
 *    FACE the target (a ±50° cone) and by being slow to extend and retract.
 *  • LAUNCHER — a short ground-intake claw PLUS a catapult. The claw is the shortest of the
 *    three (it scoops right at the edge) and does the grabbing and placing as usual. The
 *    CATAPULT is a separate trick: it FLINGS a carried ring far downfield to reposition it,
 *    and it is deliberately INACCURATE — see `CHAIN_FLING_*`. It is transport, not scoring.
 *  • TURRET — the convenience specialist. A claw on a rail + turret that tracks the nearest
 *    hook, so it works in ANY direction and never asks the driver to reorient, and it cycles
 *    fastest. Middling reach, and the heaviest of the three.
 *
 * WEIGHTS are all small in absolute terms (1.4-2.6 lb on a 20-42 lb chassis) — these are
 * claws and linkages, not drivetrains. The ORDER is what carries the balance: arm (bare
