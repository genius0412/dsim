/**
 * Chain Reaction (presented by goBILDA) — field + element constants.
 *
 * The 2026 Unofficial-FTC CAD-competition game. Values from the competition manual
 * (`cm.pdf` — its page streams are corrupt/unrenderable, so the numbers here come
 * from the manual PAGES the user supplied as images + explicit dimensions). mm are
 * converted to the sim's INCH world via `mm()` (÷25.4).
 *
 * Field: standard FTC 12'×12' (144") soft-tile field, origin at center, +x =
 * audience right, +y away from the audience. RED alliance = LEFT (columns A–C, from
 * the audience), BLUE = RIGHT (columns D–F).
 *
 * ── Terminology (manual §2–4) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  • ACCELERATOR — the alliance goal: launch PARTICLES into it (1 pt each). Sits
 *    OUTSIDE each alliance's side wall (red left, blue right).
 *  • PARTICLE — a 3"-OD wiffle ball (300 of them). Launchable from ANYWHERE.
 *
 * ── Automation (manual §3.1) — particles are NEVER consumed ─────────────────
 *  The ACCELERATOR has an auto-score + REJECT system: a launched particle is
 *  counted (scores) then LAUNCHED BACK onto the field. Pre-match it distributes all
 *  300 particles across the field (randomization); during teleop it keeps
 *  re-distributing scored particles back out. So the field always holds ~300
 *  particles. The HOOK has its own auto-score confirming a Catalyst is seated and
 *  applying the +1 pt/particle bonus. (Implement this recycle loop when particles
 *  land — a particle entering the accelerator scores + respawns onto the field.)
 *  • CATALYST — a 6"-OD purple ring (4 of them). Placed on a HOOK ⇒ +1 pt/particle.
 *  • HOOK — on the accelerator wall (this file's `CHAIN_HOOK_Y`); holds a Catalyst.
 *  • RING STAND — a 22.5" vertical steel pole at the field corners; robots ASCEND
 *    (endgame, 20 pt) / DESCEND (auto, 20 pt) it.
 *  • LAB AREA — each alliance's start/park zone (leave 5 pt auto / park 5 pt endgame).
 *  • PARTICLE ZONE — the center diamond of white tape (neutral, unprotected).
 *
 * STILL A SHELL: robots are drivable + wall-contained and the ACCELERATORS, HOOKS,
 * RING STANDS and PARTICLE ZONE are placed/drawn. Scoring/particles/catalysts and
 * the Lab-Area / column-grid geometry are NOT implemented yet (exact field-zone
 * coordinates for the Particle Zone, Lab Areas, and Ring-Stand positions are still
 * needed — approximations below are FLAGGED).
