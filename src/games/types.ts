/**
 * The GAME-ABSTRACTION seam (DOM-free core types).
 *
 * The simulator hosts more than one FTC-style game (DECODE, Chain Reaction, …).
 * Everything GENERIC — the drivetrain/motor model, the Rapier robot solver,
 * contact-torque square-up, the match phase machine, robot rendering — is shared.
 * Everything GAME-SPECIFIC lives behind a game module.
 *
 * The module is split in two so the SERVER (no DOM) can import the simulation half
 * without dragging in the browser-only renderers:
 * - `GameSimModule` (this file): id/scored/bounds/colliders/createWorld/step —
 *   everything the authoritative server + headless smoke need. NO DOM types.
 * - `GameModule` (`./module.ts`): `GameSimModule` + `drawField`/`drawOverlays`/`ui`
 *   (canvas rendering). Client-only.
 *
 * Design rules:
 * - DECODE's existing `src/sim/*` + `src/render/*` are NOT relocated; the DECODE
 *   module just references them. A new game is a new `src/games/<id>/` tree.
 * - Modules produce PLAIN-NUMBER collider specs (`StaticSpec`) — never Rapier.
 *   `physicsEngine.ts` owns RAPIER and turns specs into bodies.
 * - The shared Rapier robot solve + camera are PARAMETERIZED on a module's
 *   `bounds`/`colliders`, so a game with a different field size just works.
