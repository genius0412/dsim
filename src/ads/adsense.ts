/**
 * Google AdSense integration — the single place that decides whether ads run.
 *
 * Everything is OPT-IN through env: with `VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT` unset (the default,
 * and the state of every build until the AdSense application is approved) nothing
 * here loads, no script tag is injected, and `<AdSlot>` renders nothing. That keeps
 * the ad layer completely dormant rather than half-live.
 *
 * Three hard rules encoded here, each of which is a policy violation if broken:
 *
 *  1. NEVER in the desktop build. AdSense does not permit serving inside a
 *     non-browser application wrapper, and an Electron shell is exactly that.
 *  2. NEVER on touch devices. Not a policy rule but a product one — the compact
 *     mobile layout has no free space, and the field would have to shrink.
 *  3. NEVER for supporters. Removing ads is the headline membership benefit, so
 *     the gate has to exist from the first commit rather than be retrofitted.
 *
 * Rule 3 is reactive (it resolves asynchronously after sign-in) and so lives in
 * `AdsProvider`, not here. This module owns only the static facts.
