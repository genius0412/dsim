 * seed + robot setups + a hold-last-compressed per-tick command log. Because the
 * sim is a pure, command-driven state machine, re-running `step()` over that log
 * reproduces the match byte-for-byte — which makes replays (a) tiny (~10–30 KB),
 * (b) a continuous determinism check, and (c) the server's anti-cheat verifier
 * (re-simulate a submitted replay, trust only the score IT computes).
 *
 * Determinism rule (from net/protocol.ts): the sim must step on the value the
 * wire round-trips (`localizeCommand`), so a captured command re-simulates to
 * the same result. `runRecordMatch`/`ReplayRecorder` localize + quantize on the
 * same lattice, so record → simulate is exact. A record run is fully SIM-DRIVEN
 * (preCountdown → auto → transition → teleop → post), so no controller state
 * leaks in — {seed, setups, commands} alone reproduce it.

 *  • `balance`    — a different BALANCE_VERSION, i.e. robots perform differently now.
 *  • `behaviour`  — a different SIM_VERSION: same balance, changed physics/rules.
 *  • `unstamped`  — recorded before DSIM stamped SIM_VERSION at all, so which behaviour
 *                    produced it is genuinely UNKNOWN rather than known-different.
 *  • `tank`       — a FORMAT-1 replay of a tank-steered robot, whose drive input the
 *                    container had nowhere to store.

/**
 * WHAT, if anything, differs between that container and this build — the ONE authority.
 * `replayFidelity` and `replayPlayable` are both derived from it, so there is never a second
 * description of this rule to disagree with.
 *
 * Two different questions, kept apart on purpose:
 *  • can we PARSE it — any format up to ours, since the reader still understands the older
 *    strides. A newer one from a future build we cannot read.
 *  • can we REPRODUCE it — the balance version has to match, or `step()` produces a
 *    different game than the one that was played.
 *
 * Plus one honest refusal: a FORMAT-1 replay of a tank-steered robot never had its drive
 * input recorded at all (the container had nowhere to put `ld`/`rd`). It parses and it
 * re-simulates, but it re-simulates a robot that sits still — so it is refused rather than
 * played back looking broken, which is indistinguishable from a bug in the sim.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE FATAL TESTS COME FIRST, AND `tank` MUST PRECEDE THE SIM TEST.** A SIM mismatch is
 * only a drift (see `replayFidelity`), so if it were checked first then a format-1 tank replay
 * that ALSO predates the current SIM_VERSION — which is every one of them, format 1 being the
 * older container — would be reported as a drift and PLAYED, showing a robot that sits still.
 * The order is load-bearing, not stylistic.
 *
 * `unstamped` is a MESSAGE distinction, never a policy one: the version test stays exactly
 * `(r.sim ?? 0) !== simVersion`, so an absent stamp reads as a drift on any build past
 * SIM_VERSION 0 and as an exact match on one running 0, which is what it has always done.
 * Splitting it out changes only whether the viewer can say "recorded before we tracked this"
 * instead of naming a version the recorder never claimed.

 *
 * **THE MIDDLE CASE IS THE POINT, and it was learned the hard way.** Gating playback on
 * SIM_VERSION as well as the season once marked every DECODE match of a whole live season
 * unavailable over a float-level determinism fix — a correction worth a point or two of drift
 * took away every replay on the board. A changed SIM_VERSION moves what `step()` produces,

 * strictly better than refusing it.
