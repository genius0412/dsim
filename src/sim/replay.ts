/**
 * Deterministic REPLAYS + record-chasing (score-attack) scaffolding — Phase 3
 * foundation (docs/netcodeplan.md). A replay is NOT video/snapshots: it is the
 * seed + robot setups + a hold-last-compressed per-tick command log. Because the
 * sim is a pure, command-driven state machine, re-running `step()` over that log
 * reproduces the match byte-for-byte — which makes replays (a) tiny (~10–30 KB),
 * (b) a continuous determinism check, and (c) the server's anti-cheat verifier
 * (re-simulate a submitted replay, trust only the score IT computes).
 *
 * Determinism rule (from net/protocol.ts): the sim must step on the value the
 * wire round-trips (`localizeCommand`), so a captured command re-simulates to
 * the same result. `runRecordMatch`/`ReplayRecorder` localize + quantize on the
 * same lattice, so record → simulate is exact. A record run is fully SIM-DRIVEN
 * (preCountdown → auto → transition → teleop → post), so no controller state
 * leaks in — {seed, setups, commands} alone reproduce it.
