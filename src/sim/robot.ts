   * cannot express, and it is the whole of robot-on-robot feel — treads refusing to be dragged
   * sideways or spun, rollers giving way.
   *
   * SLICE A APPROXIMATED IT AFTER THE FACT: `solveRobots` compared the solver's answer against
   * what the drive asked for and trimmed the difference (`holdLat`/`yawHold`), Coulomb-style.
   * That works for a steady lean and fails for an impact, because trimming happens AFTER the
   * solve and cannot tell a 40 in/s hit from a 2 in/s drag except by magnitude — so a scale
   * factor (`CONTACT_YAW_HOLD`) had to split the difference, and near-centred rams stopped
   * spinning anybody.
   *
   * Now it is a FORCE, computed per wheel and handed to the solver, which resolves it
   * SIMULTANEOUSLY with the contact. The discrimination falls out for free: a lean asks for
   * less than the tyre can supply and is refused outright, while an impact asks for more than
   * `LATERAL_GRIP · accel / 4` and the excess goes through as real motion. Nothing decides
   * which case it is — the traction limit does.
   *
   * PER WHEEL AND NOT PER CHASSIS, because that is what produces the yaw. Four lateral forces
   * at their own moment arms resist a spin exactly as far as their grip allows, so the same
   * expression that stops a tank being dragged sideways stops it being twisted, and neither
   * needs a term of its own.
   *
   * THE SLIP IS MEASURED AGAINST THE COMMANDED MOTION, not against zero — that is what keeps
   * this out of the balance. A robot turning at the rate it asked for is scrubbing its wheels
   * exactly as much as the drive model already accounts for, so the deviation is zero and
   * nothing is applied; in free space the term does not exist. What it sees is the difference
   * between where the chassis is going and where the wheels are pointed, which only a contact
   * (or a wall) can produce.

     * ...OR IT IS UNDER THE VECTOR ROLLER ROW, WHICH IS THE WHOLE MOUTH.
     *
     * A FLAT preset has no slopes to walk an artifact to the throat, no `cornered` grab (that
     * one is wedge-only), and the flank grab this replaces could never fire on any legal robot:
     * it asked for `mouthHalf > half + 0.5`, and `intakeMouth` sets the vector mouth to EXACTLY
     * the chassis half-width. So the only way in was `atThroat`, a window about 7in of a 15in
     * opening, reached only by the suction walking the artifact across — which in a clump it
     * often never manages. Measured over 504 ram scenes, 46 artifacts sat INSIDE the vector
     * intake and were never eligible, against 0 for either wedge preset.
     *
     * The preset's own model is that the wheel row spans the whole mouth and VECTORS an
     * off-centre artifact to the centre, paying for it in TIME: `capMin` at the centre rising
     * to `capMax` at the edge. That cost is charged below by `t`. Requiring the artifact to
     * ALREADY be centred charged it twice — once as a delay and once as a precondition — and
     * only the delay was ever intended. So the roller row grabs where it lies and the timing
     * does the vectoring, which leaves vector the slowest of the three by exactly the margin
     * `capMin`/`capMax`/`clumpInterval` already give it. No suction, mouth or interval constant
     * moves, and the branch is gated on `!m.wedge`, so sloped and triangle are untouched.
