/**
 * WHAT IS SITTING IN THE GATE'S MOUTH.
 *
 * The exit is a real place with a real volume, and until now the drain ignored that: a ball
 * reaching RAIL_EXIT_S became a ground artifact at a fixed point below the gate no matter
 * what already occupied it. Park a robot over the outflow and artifacts materialised inside
 * it and piled up — teleporting into an occupied space, which is the one thing the ball
 * lifecycle is not allowed to do.
 *
 * So the mouth is checked before anything leaves (`railBlock`):
 *   `s`     — how far up the rail a robot's body reaches. That becomes the column's floor, so
 *             it backs up against the bumper wherever the bumper actually is. A robot NEVER
 *             takes an artifact off the rail: it has to come out of the gate first.
 *
 * ONLY A ROBOT BLOCKS OUTRIGHT. An artifact lying in the doorway is a different case and
 * must not be treated as one: making it block deadlocked the whole classifier, because a
 * drained artifact rolls a couple of inches, friction stops it dead in the mouth, and the
 * column behind it can then never leave — and since the flow never completes, the gate is
 * held open forever and never falls closed. Letting it through instead is no better: the
 * new artifact lands on top of the old one, which is the pop-and-stack that started all
 * this (measured at 4.3in of overlap on a 5in artifact).
 *
 * So the column PUSHES it (see `doorwayArtifact`): the artifact in the way is shoved along
 * with the same exit velocity and the release waits a tick for it to clear. That is what
 * the artifacts behind it do on a real ramp, it cannot deadlock (the shove is applied every
 * tick), and if something genuinely immovable is pinning it — a robot parked down the
 * tunnel — then the column stalling IS the right answer.
 */
/**
 * WHERE A ROBOT STOPS THE COLUMN — an `s` on the rail, not a yes/no at one point.
 *
 * This used to test the single point `railPos(a, RAIL_EXIT_S)` and return a boolean. Both
 * halves of that were wrong, and measurably so. A robot sitting ON the mouth stopped the
 * flow but the floor stayed at RAIL_EXIT_S, so the column stacked up to 7.3in INSIDE the
 * chassis and sat there — the artifacts visibly inside the robot. And a robot 9in to the
 * side, touching nothing, still blocked the whole ramp, because the one point it tested was
 * the only geometry the rail knew about.
 *
 * So walk the rail line instead and find the highest `s` the robot's body actually reaches.
 * That `s` (plus an artifact radius, so it rests AGAINST the bumper rather than in it) is the
 * column's floor. Partial coverage now does the partial thing: the column stops where the
 * robot is, wherever that happens to be, and stops nothing when the robot is clear.
 *
 * Only the stretch below the classifier's gate end is walked — above it the channel has
 * walls and a robot cannot be in it at all.

     * paddle hovering at maximum lift, clear of everything, with nobody touching it. A
     * hinged arm cannot do that, and it is why a tap emptied the whole ramp: measured, a
     * tap drained EVERY column up to six artifacts, two of them during the latch alone,
     * and the arm never got the chance to come down onto the flow at all.
     *
     * What a tap really does is throw the arm up and let go. `GATE_OPEN_LATCH_S` is now the
     * arm's mechanical OVERSWING — the moment of its own momentum carrying past the release
     * — and the rest of "it stays open a beat without holding" comes from where it actually
     * comes from: the FALL. Gravity takes ~0.23s to bring it from full lift back to the pass
     * line, artifacts flow the whole way down, and then it lands on the column and meters.
     * The product decision (a tap opens it; the driver does not keep pressing) is intact —
     * a tap still commits it fully open and still drains. It just no longer drains all of it.
     *
     * TOUCH-HOLD is unchanged and is the case that legitimately pins the arm: a robot
     * resting against an already-open arm really does hold it up, indefinitely, and that is
     * what makes a HELD gate stream.

       * that is already shut — which is right, and is not what that test says. GATE_PASS_FRAC
       * is where an artifact can get THROUGH; the paddle is reachable from underneath long
       * before that. So an arm a hair under the pass line was a wall: the artifact behind the
       * one that just left arrived, found 0.35, and was simply stopped. "A tap only lets out
       * one ball, because a ball coming out is not lifting the gate back up."
       *
       * `gateRestOn(d)` at the moment of contact is the honest threshold — it IS the height
       * the paddle sits at when it is resting on that artifact's surface. Above it, the ball
       * is under the paddle edge and its momentum swings the arm; below it, the paddle's face
       * is in the way and the ball is stopped, which is exactly what a shut gate must do.
       * A flat arm (0) is therefore still a wall to an artifact arriving at any speed, so a
       * SHUT gate still retains — the retention checks are what pin this down.
       *
       * The knock is still only worth what the artifact is carrying, and that self-limits:
       * from 0.2 the rise is (speed * GATE_KNOCK)^2 / (2 * GATE_GRAVITY), so ~25 in/s is
       * needed to reach the pass line and a faltering flow lands short and ends the drain.
