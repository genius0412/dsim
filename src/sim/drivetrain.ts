 * the gearing leaves for pushing, and `1 − powerDraw` is the current the flywheel and intake
 * are not taking.

 * ...AND THE COLLIDER MASS THAT DELIVERS IT.

 * velocity each tick and the contact resolves as an inelastic collision between two masses.
 * The momentum a robot injects per tick is therefore `mass × accel × dt` — so the FORCE it
 * delivers is `mass × accel`, and the collider mass that produces a wanted force is that force
 * divided by the accel the motor model actually used this tick.
 *
 * Everything else was double-counted before this existed, because `accel` already carries
 * `REF_MASS_LB / massLb`, `REF_DRIVE_RPM / rpm` and `1 − powerDraw`:
 *   • massLb cancelled outright — a 20 lb robot pushed exactly as hard as a 42 lb one
 *     (measured: force 5591 at BOTH ends of the slider) while the comment claimed weight was
 *     the headline term;
 *   • the rpm factor landed twice (7.45x spread instead of 2.48x, clamp defeated);
 *   • power draw landed twice (x0.64 at the cap instead of x0.80).
 * Dividing the accel back out makes `pushForce` the whole answer and each factor act once.
 *
 * `powerDraw` cancels between the two expressions TODAY. It is written out anyway: the point
 * is that the force is right whatever `accel` happens to contain, and a future edit to either
 * side must not silently re-open the double-count.
 *
 * ONE NUMBER, THREE JOBS. Rapier reads this mass for the sustained shove, for the momentum
 * split of a ram, and for the positional split when two chassis overlap; the bespoke pair
 * impulse in physics.ts reads it for rotational inertia. They are all "how much authority does
 * this robot have in a collision", which is what the quantity means — it is NOT the robot's
 * weight, and `driveParams().accel` still uses the real `massLb`.
