/**
 * DECODE penalty engine (Competition Manual Section 11). Pure and
 * deterministic: it reads only world.time, robot positions/velocities, the
 * per-tick command map, and world.rrContacts (robot-robot contacts recorded by
 * the collision solver). All state lives in world.penalties as plain JSON, so
 * the sim stays serializable and locklockstep-safe for netcode.
 *
 * Fouls are awarded TO the victim alliance (awardFoul in scoring.ts). Most
 * rules trigger on a CROSS-alliance contact pair while a robot sits in a zone;
 * a per-episode debounce (PENALTY_CLEAR) makes a held contact fire once, not
 * every tick. Pinning (G422) owns a per-ordered-pair second-accumulator.
 *
 * Rules modeled here (numbers/severities per Competition Manual Section 11):
 *   G402  AUTO opponent interference   (MAJOR) — fully on the opponent's side
 *                                       (own side = goalSide: robots stage near
 *                                       their GOAL) while contacting an opponent
 *   G408  over-possession               (MINOR per artifact over the limit, + a
 *                                       YELLOW CARD if excessive) — CONTROLLING more
 *                                       than POSSESSION_LIMIT artifacts (hopper +
 *                                       herded loose balls) past a short grace
 *   G422  pinning ≥3 s                 (MINOR, and another every 3 s it is not corrected)
 *   G417  operating an OPPONENT's GATE  (MAJOR) — contacting/working their gate
 *   G418  artifact off an opponent RAMP (MAJOR per artifact) — each classified
 *                                       ball that leaves an opponent's ramp
 *                                       because you opened their gate (G418.B)
 *   G424  GATE ZONE off limits         (MINOR) — cross-alliance contact while a
 *                                       robot is in a gate zone; protects the
 *                                       gate OWNER's access to their own gate
 *   G425  SECRET TUNNEL                (MINOR) — contact while in the tunnel strip
 *   G426  LOADING ZONE protection      (MINOR)
 *   G427  BASE ZONE protection, endgame (MAJOR + counts the victim fully returned)
 *
 * Uniform "protected zone" model: gate/loading/base zones belong to the alliance
 * whose side they sit on (foul the OTHER alliance on contact); the secret-tunnel
 * strip on a wall belongs to the OPPOSING drive team (tunnelStrip(a) is owned by
 * other(a), so the intruder/offender is alliance a).
 *
 * Rules PHYSICALLY PREVENTED by construction (no code needed):
 *   G403/G417  transition freeze — robots are disabled outside auto/teleop.
 *   G416  out-of-zone launching — the shooter simply refuses (see robot.ts).
 * Deferrable (not yet modeled): G423 shutting down major gameplay (incl.
 * completely blocking the opponent's gate — needs "completely blocking" +
 * duration judgment) and displacing an opponent's pre-staged spike artifacts
 * (G402.B).

/**
 * A ROBOT IS "IN" A ZONE IF ANY PART OF IT IS — ONE PREDICATE, EVERY ZONE RULE.
 *
 * Every DECODE zone is defined in Section 9 and the glossary as an "infinitely tall volume"
 * (GATE 2.75x10, SECRET TUNNEL 46.5x6.125, LOADING 23x23, BASE 18x18), and the rules that use
 * them all ask whether a ROBOT "is in" one. So the test is plain OVERLAP between that volume's
 * footprint and the robot's TOP-DOWN SILHOUETTE — the collision OBB, intake reach included,
 * since an overhang is as much inside an infinitely tall volume as a wheel is.
 *
 * It was a corner/center containment test, which is not the same thing and is strictly weaker:
 * a robot whose BODY covers part of a zone while its four corners straddle it and its center
 * sits outside was not in the zone. That is not exotic — it is a BASE ZONE corner poking into
 * the middle of a robot's edge, or a robot lying across the tunnel strip, which is narrower
 * (6.125in) than any legal robot. G424 already used the SAT test for exactly this reason; the
 * other three rules read the same word in the same manual and now answer it the same way.
 *
 * Don't confuse this with BASE PARKING SCORING, which is deliberately NOT this test: a ROBOT
 * "returned to BASE" is defined by SUPPORT ("must only be supported ... by the TILE in the
 * BASE ZONE"), so that one counts wheel ground-contact points and belongs in scoring.ts.
 * G427 protects the ZONE, the BASE award measures what the TILE holds up; the manual draws
 * that line itself, and so do we.

 * HOW MANY ARTIFACTS THIS ROBOT IS CONTROLLING.

 * the object remains in approximately the same position relative to the ROBOT") and a TRAPPING
 * ("preventing the movement of a SCORING ELEMENT against a FIELD element") — and NEITHER IS IN
 * THIS MANUAL. There is no POSSESSION entry and no TRAPPING entry in the DECODE glossary; the
 * word TRAPPING does not appear in Section 11 at all, and the only PIN/PINNING definition is
 * about opponent ROBOTS. The quoted TRAPPING was DECODE's PIN/PINNING with "opponent ROBOT"
 * swapped for "SCORING ELEMENT". Two invented tests carried most of the weight of the rule.
 *
 * The real definition, verbatim (Section 16, V2):
 *
 *   "an action by a ROBOT in which the SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by or stuck in, on,
 *    or under the ROBOT or it intentionally pushes a SCORING ELEMENT to a desired location or
 *    in a preferred direction (i.e., herding). CONTROL requires contact with a ROBOT, either
 *    directly or transitively through other SCORING ELEMENTS. Typically, CONTROL requires one
 *    of the following to be true:
 *      A. The SCORING ELEMENT is fully supported by the ROBOT
 *      B. The ROBOT is moving the SCORING ELEMENT in a preferred direction with a flat or
 *         concave face of the ROBOT"
 *
 * So there are exactly two ways to control an artifact, and this function is the two of them:
 *
 *   A. FULLY SUPPORTED — the hopper. `r.hopper.length`, added at the bottom.
 *   B. HERDING — "intentionally pushes ... to a desired location or in a preferred direction",
 *      which decomposes into four things the code can actually ask:
 *        · CONTACT with the footprint (the definition says so outright), directly or
 *          TRANSITIVELY through other artifacts;
 *        · a FLAT OR CONCAVE FACE — `contactFace` returns null off a convex CORNER, which is
 *          the one piece of geometry clause B names and the engine had never modelled;
 *        · IN A PREFERRED DIRECTION — the robot's own rigid-body velocity AT the contact point
 *          must carry it INTO the artifact along that face's outward normal. A direction, not
 *          a speed: the previous test was the artifact's ABSOLUTE speed, which says nothing
 *          about who is moving it or where;
 *        · INTENTIONALLY — sustained past POSSESSION_CONFIRM while the artifact keeps its
 *          station on the chassis. The manual gives no numeric test for intent, so this is the
 *          sim's proxy for a referee's eye, and it is the whole of the BULLDOZING and
 *          DEFLECTING carve-outs: something you clip in passing never lasts, and something
 *          that bounces off leaves at once.
 *
 * ...AND "TO A DESIRED LOCATION" IS WHY CONTROL LATCHES.
 *
 * Once herding has been established the artifact stays controlled while contact and station
 * hold, whether or not the robot is still pushing — because having pushed it somewhere and
 * held it there is the first half of that phrase. This is what replaced the invented TRAPPING
 * branch, and it lands in the same place from the real definition: a robot that drove a pile
 * into the perimeter and sits on it is controlling the pile. Measured before this change, that
 * robot paid four MINORs once and then held the pile for the rest of the match for free.
 *
 * It also removes the two ABSOLUTE-SPEED gates that stood in front of the whole rule. There is
 * no speed floor anywhere in the definition, and the floors were exploitable in both
 * directions: a hoard crept below POSSESSION_MOVE_SPEED was invisible (measured: a six-artifact
 * pile walked for twelve seconds, zero fouls), and a jammed pile read as uncontrolled precisely
 * because it could not move. A robot that never pushed anything never latches, so the case that
 * these gates were reached for — "I'm getting spammed with over-possession continuing penalties
 * just by standing still" — is answered by intent rather than by a velocity threshold.
