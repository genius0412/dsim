/**
 * DECODE penalty engine (Competition Manual Section 11). Pure and
 * deterministic: it reads only world.time, robot positions/velocities, the
 * per-tick command map, and world.rrContacts (robot-robot contacts recorded by
 * the collision solver). All state lives in world.penalties as plain JSON, so
 * the sim stays serializable and locklockstep-safe for netcode.
 *
 * Fouls are awarded TO the victim alliance (awardFoul in scoring.ts). Most
 * rules trigger on a CROSS-alliance contact pair while a robot sits in a zone;
 * a per-episode debounce (PENALTY_CLEAR) makes a held contact fire once, not
 * every tick. Pinning (G422) owns a per-ordered-pair second-accumulator.
 *
 * Rules modeled here (numbers/severities per Competition Manual Section 11):
 *   G402  AUTO opponent interference   (MAJOR) — fully on the opponent's side
 *                                       (own side = goalSide: robots stage near
 *                                       their GOAL) while contacting an opponent
 *   G408  over-possession / plowing    (MINOR) — CONTROLLING more than
 *                                       POSSESSION_LIMIT artifacts (hopper +
 *                                       herded loose balls) past a short grace
 *   G422  pinning ≥3 s                 (MINOR, MAJOR on a repeat by the same pinner)
 *   G417  operating an OPPONENT's GATE  (MAJOR) — contacting/working their gate
 *   G418  artifact off an opponent RAMP (MAJOR per artifact) — each classified
 *                                       ball that leaves an opponent's ramp
 *                                       because you opened their gate (G418.B)
 *   G424  GATE ZONE off limits         (MINOR) — cross-alliance contact while a
 *                                       robot is in a gate zone; protects the
 *                                       gate OWNER's access to their own gate
 *   G425  SECRET TUNNEL                (MINOR) — contact while in the tunnel strip
 *   G426  LOADING ZONE protection      (MINOR)
 *   G427  BASE ZONE protection, endgame (MAJOR + counts the victim fully returned)
 *
 * Uniform "protected zone" model: gate/loading/base zones belong to the alliance
 * whose side they sit on (foul the OTHER alliance on contact); the secret-tunnel
 * strip on a wall belongs to the OPPOSING drive team (tunnelStrip(a) is owned by
 * other(a), so the intruder/offender is alliance a).
 *
 * Rules PHYSICALLY PREVENTED by construction (no code needed):
 *   G403/G417  transition freeze — robots are disabled outside auto/teleop.
 *   G416  out-of-zone launching — the shooter simply refuses (see robot.ts).
 * Deferrable (not yet modeled): G423 shutting down major gameplay (incl.
 * completely blocking the opponent's gate — needs "completely blocking" +
 * duration judgment) and displacing an opponent's pre-staged spike artifacts
 * (G402.B).
