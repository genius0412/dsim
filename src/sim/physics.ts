/**
 * ⚠️ A FEEL CONSTANT ON TOP OF THE PHYSICAL ANSWER, NOT PHYSICS. Say so out loud, because

 *
 * `solveArtifacts` answers "how much does a clump slow me down" honestly, and the honest answer
 * is SMALL: `BALL_MASS` is 0.2lb against a `shoveMass` of 15-25, so the emergent steady-state
 * loss measured on 1 / 3 / 6 / 9 artifacts shoved across open floor is 0.4 / 1.1 / 2.2 / 2.8%,
 * where the old hand-written pass gave 9.9 / 18.5 / 18.6 / 18.7%. A real 5in wiffle ball
 * really does not slow a 23lb robot down much, and the sim is not wrong about that.
 *
 * It is kept anyway, at its ORIGINAL strength — `BALL_PUSH_DRAG` is not retuned by any of
 * this — for two reasons, both about the game rather than about mechanics:
 *
 *  · A clump is meant to READ as something you are shifting. The physical number is below the
 *    threshold where a driver can feel anything at all.
 *  · G408's carry test integrates the artifact's own speed, so how fast a robot can bulldoze
 *    a pile across the field is a RULES input, not just a feel one — and smoke pins the two
 *    scenes at either end of it. Without this the "nosing into a clump and backing off" scene
 *    goes from 0 MINORs to 2: at full throttle an undragged robot covers 80in in the 1.2s it
 *    is meant to be nosing, which herds the pile the length of the field.
 *
 * Together: 10.1 / 19.2 / 20.0 / 20.2% on those same 1 / 3 / 6 / 9, against the old 9.9 /
 * 18.5 / 18.6 / 18.7. The SHAPE is the part that improved, and that part is physics — the old
 * constant SATURATED at three artifacts, because only the row actually touching the bumper
 * bled anything and a chassis is three artifacts wide. The solve carries the mass BEHIND that
 * row, so a bigger clump is genuinely heavier now and this scales what is already there.
 *
 * A PURE DAMPER, and that is the whole of what makes it safe under a force model. It has no
 * direction of its own — it can only ever oppose the speed the robot is closing at, and it
 * touches neither the pose nor the heading. The pass this is the surviving half of also
 * STALLED the robot and squared its chassis, and those writes persisted once the drive
 * stopped overwriting `r.vel` every tick: the chassis wedged 8.2 degrees off its commanded
 * heading and slid diagonally at 24.0 in/s. A damper cannot do that; it has nothing to wedge.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT RUNS BEFORE `solveArtifacts`, AND THAT IS NOT A LEFTOVER FROM THE OLD ORDER. Placed AFTER
 * the solve it bleeds a velocity the robot has already been MOVED at, so the pose advances
 * and the velocity does not, and the next tick's drive answers the lower velocity with more
 * torque — the chassis creeps into the pile a little further every tick. Measured on the
 * grind sweep: worst overlap 2.39 -> 4.15in on a 2.5in radius with 67 ticks of an artifact
 * CENTRE inside the chassis, against 0 such ticks and 1.93in worst with the same constant on
 * this side of the solve. In front of the solve it is simply the speed the robot arrives at,
 * which is a thing a seed velocity is allowed to be.

 * `from` — where the artifact was at the START of the tick, when the caller knows it.
 *
 * Without it, an artifact whose CENTRE has crossed inside can only be pushed out the
 * nearest FACE, by depth+radius. For the 6in classifier channel that is up to 5.5in in one
 * tick, and it was measured at 3.70in on an artifact at REST — pushed 1.2in into the
 * channel by the ball-ball separation pass (which knows nothing about statics) and
 * teleported back out by this one. That trade is what "they keep teleporting up and down
 * the classifier depending on how I turn the robot" looks like from the driver's seat.
 *
 * With `from`, an artifact that entered THIS TICK is walked back along the path it took,
 * so the correction is bounded by how far it actually travelled and points the way it came
 * instead of sideways. The face push stays for anything already inside at the start of the
 * tick (a flight artifact that landed in the channel) — there is no path to undo there.
 *
 * NOTE both ground call sites must pass it. Passing it only to the pre-relaxation one
 * changed nothing measurable, because the eviction that actually fires here is the one
 * INSIDE the relaxation loop, right after the separation pass that caused the overlap.
