/**
 * Rapier 2D physics bridge (netcodeplan Phase 2, robots-first slice).
 *
 * The sim's `World` stays the single canonical, JSON-serializable source of
 * truth. Each `step()` builds a FRESH Rapier world from the robots' current
 * poses, steps it once, and writes the resolved translation + velocity back —
 * then frees it. Statelessness is deliberate: `game.ts` reconcile swaps
 * `this.world` for a fresh snapshot up to 60×/s, so a Rapier world keyed to
 * object identity would rebuild-and-leak WASM every frame. Rebuild-per-step
 * makes reconcile and bit-for-bit determinism trivially correct, and building
 * a handful of colliders + N bodies is microseconds.
 *
 * Rapier OWNS robot translation + velocity (→ wall/robot velocity-kill,
 * mass-weighted shoving, restitution-0 inelastic contact, and — because
 * RobotState is canonical and rebuilt each tick — pinned-ball feedback, all for
 * free). Rotation is LOCKED on the bodies; the bespoke contact-torque "square
 * up flush" nudge stays in physics.ts (`squareUpRobots`), the one piece the
 * plan calls out as not a Rapier primitive.
 *
 * Slice 2 adds GROUND balls to the SAME unified solve (circle bodies, tiny
 * mass), so ball↔ball / ball↔robot / ball↔wall / ball↔goal-face /
 * ball↔classifier resolve together — and the pinned-ball → robot feedback falls
 * out of a real mass ratio. Rolling friction + rest-snap + the hard field clamp
 * stay bespoke around the solve (top-down plane has no floor to rub on, and
 * Rapier's soft contacts allow ~0.2in penetration the containment invariant
 * won't tolerate). Restitution combines with `Min` across every collider so the
 * per-pair coefficients fall straight out of the BALL_* constants. FLIGHT balls
 * (ballistic + rare low collisions) stay bespoke in world.ts / physics.ts.
