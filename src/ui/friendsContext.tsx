 * Before this, `useFriends` was mounted separately by the panel, the profile
 * page, and the invite flyout — three timers, three caches, a double-poll whenever
 * two co-mounted. This provider mounts it ONCE (wrapping `AppShell`) so every
 * surface reads the same live data, and it's the natural home for the two things
 * that need app-level reach:
 *
 *  - **Challenge** (chess.com's core loop): create a room, invite a friend to it,
 *    and drop yourself into the lobby as host — reachable from a friend row, a
 *    profile, anywhere. Needs both the friends API (the invite) AND navigation
 *    (host the room), so it lives here where both are in scope.
 *  - **Notifications**: a new incoming request or invite should announce itself
 *    even when the panel is collapsed. The store sees every poll, so it diffs new
 *    arrivals into transient toasts.
 *
 * Full-screen room flows mount this provider too, so their persistent panel
 * shares the same single poller and invitation behavior as the menu shell.
