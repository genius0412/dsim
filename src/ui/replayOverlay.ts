/**
 * THE SCOREBOARD, BURNED INTO A REPLAY VIDEO.
 *
 * The viewer's scoreboard is React DOM sitting ABOVE the canvas (`.ds-replay-score`), and the
 * video is a capture of the canvas — so the export had no score in it at all, and no sign of
 * when the match started or what it finished. On screen that split is invisible, because the
 * page supplies the half the canvas does not; in a file that leaves a match nobody can read.
 * A video is also the one export that outlives the sim (`replayRefusal` retires the container,
 * never the recording), so it is exactly the artifact that has to stand on its own.
 *
 * IT NEVER COVERS THE FIELD, and the camera's reserved bands are not enough to promise that.
 * `HUD_BOTTOM` shrinks to 4px on a compact or short layout, and the field is centred in what
 * is left, so how much clear space sits under it depends on the viewer's aspect ratio — on
 * some it is generous and on others the field runs straight into the bar. So the caller asks
 * `fieldScreenBottom` where the field actually ENDS and gives the frame `HUD_RESERVE` more
 * height when there is not already room. Extra letterbox costs nothing; a scoreboard sitting
 * on top of the match costs the match.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT SETS ITS OWN TRANSFORM, and must. `Renderer.render` leaves the context in FIELD
 * INCHES — translated, scaled and rotated by the driver's view angle — so an overlay that
 * assumed CSS pixels drew its scoreboard somewhere off in the field's coordinate space and
 * produced a video with nothing on it at all. Working in CSS units (`Camera.w`/`Camera.h`
 * scaled by `dpr`) is also what keeps the bar the same SIZE relative to the field at every
 * encode resolution, instead of shrinking as the pixels go up.

 * protrude), and how the fit landed. Taking the max over the four corners covers every
