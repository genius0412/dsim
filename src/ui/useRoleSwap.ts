/**
 * 2v2 start-ROLE negotiation. An alliance fills one CLOSE and one FAR slot; the
 * role limits which start-position category each robot may pick. The role
 * defaults to alliance join order (first by clientId = close, second = far) but
 * either member can propose a SWAP that the other must ACCEPT.
 *
 * The handshake rides two self-patched roster flags (no cross-patching, no new
 * server message): a member proposes by setting `swapReq`; the partner accepts by
 * setting theirs too; when BOTH are set each client flips ITS OWN role to the
 * opposite and clears its flag — race-free and convergent (they always held
 * opposite roles, so flipping both = a swap). A `enacted` ref stops a double-flip
 * during the patch→broadcast window. Only meaningful with exactly two members.
