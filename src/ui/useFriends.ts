/**
 * Adaptive poll cadence (only ever runs while the tab is VISIBLE — see below).
 * When something is pending a resolution — an incoming request/challenge, an
 * outgoing request, a live invite — we poll FAST so the interactive moment feels
 * near-instant (this is the low-lift stand-in for a real WebSocket push). When
 * nothing's in flight we back off to keep a scale-to-zero Fly machine cheap.
 *
 * The fast rate is BOUNDED IN TIME, and that bound is the point. "Something is
 * pending" is not the same as "something is happening": an outgoing request the
 * other person never answers stays pending for days, and unbounded that pinned
 * this poll at the fast rate for as long as the tab stayed open - a permanent 3x
 * on the busiest authenticated query on the site, spent watching a row that was
 * never going to change. The window restarts whenever the pending set actually
 * CHANGES, so a real interactive moment stays fast and only a stalled one decays.
 *
 * POLL_IDLE_MS is deliberately well under the server's 45s online window
 * (ONLINE_WINDOW_S in repo.ts): this request doubles as the caller's presence
 * heartbeat, so a slower idle rate would make people flicker offline to their
 * friends on a single missed poll. It is not a free cost dial.
