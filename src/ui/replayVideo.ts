/**
 * Recording a replay to a VIDEO FILE.
 *
 * A replay is an input log, and `replayRefusal` retires one the moment SIM_VERSION moves —
 * deliberately, because a changed sim re-simulates the same inputs into a different game. So the
 * container is a perishable artifact: exact today, refused after the next patch.
 *
 * A video is the opposite. It stops being a re-simulation and becomes a recording, which means
 * it outlives every patch, needs no sim to watch, and can be shared with someone who does not
 * have DSIM at all.
 *
 * ONE PATH NOW, and it is `VideoEncoder` (WebCodecs) plus the two little muxers next door. It
 * encodes frames the caller hands it, each carrying its own timestamp, so the replay can be
 * simulated and drawn as fast as the machine manages while the file still comes out the right
 * LENGTH. All three formats go through it, MP4 included.
 *
 * `MediaRecorder` survives ONLY as the fallback for a browser with no H.264 in WebCodecs. It
 * cannot go faster than real time and never will, because it stamps frames by when they ARRIVE
 * rather than by the timestamp they carry: measured, 300 frames explicitly stamped for 5.00s of
 * video came out as files of 1.39s and 0.05s depending only on how quickly they were written.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE QUALITY PROBLEM WAS RESOLUTION, NOT BITRATE — measured, against every guess.
 *
 * Reported as "video quality is horrible", the obvious suspects were the rate control and the
 * `latencyMode: 'realtime'` this used to ship. Both turned out to be nearly irrelevant. Encoding
 * the same 7s of match and scoring each result against the scene re-rendered at 1920 (PSNR over
 * three sampled frames):
 *
 *   old path, 2× render downsampled to 1280, realtime  1.84 Mbps   **35.5 dB**
 *   1920 native, quantizer 34                          1.52 Mbps   42.25 dB
 *   1920 native, quantizer 22                          1.88 Mbps   42.40 dB
 *   1920 native, quantizer 10                          2.47 Mbps   42.55 dB
 *
 * Nearly SEVEN dB, all of it from drawing the frame at the size it is encoded at instead of
 * shrinking a bigger one — while sweeping the quantizer across its whole useful range moves
 * 0.3 dB and 1.6× the file size. (The ~42.5 dB ceiling is 4:2:0 chroma subsampling, which no
 * encoder setting here can buy back.) The rate control is set deliberately anyway, because
 * "barely matters on this content" is not "cannot matter on any", but the ORDER of the two
 * facts is the point: a bitrate argued about in the abstract cost real time here.
 *
 * `latencyMode` is `'quality'` regardless, because it is simply the truthful description: every
 * frame is in hand and the file is written at the end, so there is no deadline to trade against.
