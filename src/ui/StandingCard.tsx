/**
 * ACCOUNT STANDING, as the player sees it.
 *
 * The design rule here is that NOTHING IS HIDDEN. A behaviour system that shows a player a
 * penalty without the reason for it, or a score without a way back up, is the thing people
 * mean when they call moderation arbitrary — so this shows the tier, exactly what it
 * restricts, what each offence cost, and what earns it back, in that order.
 *
 * IT ONLY APPEARS WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING TO SAY. A player in good standing with no history
 * gets one quiet line; the meter, the ledger and the recovery note are for people who have
 * actually spent some. Showing a full bar and an empty offence list to everyone would turn a
 * penalty system into a permanent accusation.
 */

/**
 * The standing METER — a semicircular gauge, the shape a player already reads as "how full
 * is this" from every mobile game that has one.
 *
 * It replaces a coloured dot. A dot can only ever say WHICH tier, never how far into it you
 * are or how close the next one is, so the number beside it was doing all the work and the
 * dot was decoration. An arc answers both at a glance, and it is the one element on the card
 * that has to survive being looked at for half a second.
 *
 * Geometry: a 180° arc of radius `R` centred on the baseline, drawn twice — the track, then
 * the fill, whose length is set by `stroke-dasharray` rather than by a computed path, so the
 * sweep is one interpolated number and nothing has to re-derive an arc endpoint. Round caps,
 * because a square end at 1% reads as a rendering artefact.
