/**
 * Report a MISSCORE — a claim that the match's final score was wrong.
 *
 * A SEPARATE dialog from `ReportDialog`, not a seventh reason inside it, because it is not
 * the same kind of claim. A player report names a person and says they misbehaved; a
 * misscore names nobody — the score is the server's own arithmetic, so if it is wrong the
 * fault is the sim's, and asking the reporter to pick a culprit off the roster would be
 * asking them to invent one.
 *
 * That is also why this asks for one thing and asks for it plainly: what the score should
 * have been, and what happened that the sim got wrong. A moderator settles it by opening the
 * replay the match already stored, and the only thing a category would add is a taxonomy
 * nobody can act on.
 *
 * FREE TEXT IS REQUIRED here, where it is optional on a player report. "The score was wrong"
 * with nothing after it cannot be checked against anything, and the queue this feeds is one
 * where an unfounded claim costs the filer standing — so the form should make it hard to
 * file one by accident and easy to file a real one well.
