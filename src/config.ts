 * SIM BEHAVIOUR version — "which builds can re-simulate a replay", which is a
 * DIFFERENT question from "which competitive season is this".
 *
 * BALANCE_VERSION answers the second: it keys leaderboards, so bumping it starts
 * a fresh season and archives the standings. That makes it the wrong tool for the
 * first. A determinism or float-level physics FIX changes what `step()` produces
 * without being a balance decision at all — and shipping one has only two
 * outcomes if this axis doesn't exist: reset everyone's season over a bug fix, or
 * leave stored replays silently re-simulating into a different game than the one
 * that was played. That second option is the exact failure this constant exists
 * to prevent, so it gets its own number.
 *
 * Bump on ANY change to sim math, physics, or step ordering that moves the
 * output. Never reset it. Leaderboards, ELO and seasons DO NOT read it — only
 * replay playback does (`ReplayView` refuses a mismatch and says so).
 *
 * ALPHA HOLDS AT 2 AND STAYS THERE. Alpha's whole divergence from main is ONE unreleased
 * batch, so it is ONE step past main's 1 — bumping again for each change inside that batch
 * just churns a number nobody can act on, and invalidates alpha replays for no gain. Bump
 * this again only when MAIN moves, or when alpha ships.
 *
 * 1: sim-reachable Math.hypot -> hyp (engine-independent; see src/math.ts) — MAIN is here.
 * 2: the alpha batch, everything below, which all moves `step()` output:
 *    · CR butterfly drivetrain / twin turret / catalyst mechanisms / corner geometry /
 *      start legality;
 *    · DECODE's G418.B fix — a gate tap no longer bills the standing ramp column;
 *    · ROBOT-ON-ROBOT PUSHING rebuilt: the shove is a stated FORCE with the collider mass
 *      derived from it (`pushForce`/`shoveMass`), so weight, gearing and power draw each act
 *      once instead of cancelling or landing twice; a shoved chassis gets a real two-body
 *      contact impulse, so an off-centre hit spins it; the press scaling every robot-robot
 *      response is the pair's CLOSING velocity, not each robot's absolute one; a robot held
 *      against a surface by an opponent feels that load; an auto-path robot is solid instead
 *      of intangible; pair and static responses are summed before either is written; and
 *      contacts are stiffer (PHYS_CONTACT_FREQ 8 -> 12);
 *    · G422 PINNING rewritten against the rule's own clauses — "preventing the movement"
 *      requires the pinner to be IN THE WAY of where the victim is trying to go, "attempting
 *      to move" reads side-drive so a tank can be pinned at all, the count ends only on
 *      criteria A/B/C (pausing and resuming rather than dying on a 0.6 s lapse), and it bills
 *      a MINOR every 3 s instead of one MINOR with an invented MAJOR escalation;
 *    · G408 OVER-POSSESSION rewritten against DECODE's CONTROL definition instead of an FRC
 *      POSSESSION and an invented TRAPPING (neither term is in this manual). Control is
 *      ACQUIRED by herding — a flat-or-concave face, the robot moving the artifact a real
 *      DISTANCE in the push direction, sustained past the confirm window — and LATCHES while
 *      contact holds, so a pile driven into the wall keeps counting while one already resting
 *      there never starts. An established hold keeps counting while it DRAINS, because
 *      artifacts bounce off a bumper rather than riding it. The mouth carve-out is capped at
 *      what the rollers take in one cycle rather than at hopper room, the loading-zone
 *      carve-out is scoped to a robot actually in there, an excused artifact conducts the
 *      transitive chain without being counted, and the per-artifact clocks are swept and
 *      cleared outside auto/teleop;
 *    · PENALTIES ARE ASSESSED IN FREE DRIVE — `freeplay` is a live phase everywhere else in
 *      the sim, and `updatePenalties` was the one place that excluded it;
 *    · a robot-robot contact that is SLIDING no longer aligns the pair, so a pusher is not
 *      steered by the victim escaping it (`CONTACT_SLIP_RELIEF`);
 *    · G422 no longer needs a WALL — an open-field pin is billed, with the asymmetry coming
 *      from the pinner driving in and from a cornered robot counting as escaping, not pinning;
 *    · G422 no longer needs the victim to be struggling — an idle victim held against a wall
 *      is pinned, gated instead on the PINNER driving into it (`PIN_PRESS_COS`);
 *    · G422 recognises the ORDINARY WALL PIN. The obstruction test asked whether the PINNER
 *      lay along where the victim was trying to go — true of a straight reverse, false of every
 *      SIDEWAYS exit — so a robot held flat against a wall and strafing to get out was ruled
 *      un-pinned however stuck it was, and billed NOTHING where the pre-rewrite code billed a
 *      MINOR. It now tests the VICTIM's intent instead (is it driving into the trap, or trying
 *      to leave), which is what the rule's "transitive ... against a FIELD element" describes;
 *    · BUMPER FRICTION IS BOUNDED (`capDrag`). The sim pushes by SETTING VELOCITY, so Rapier's
 *      normal impulse is whatever a drive-in costs and its Coulomb friction was a fraction of
 *      an unbounded number — a tank commanding nothing but straight forward was carried 58in
 *      sideways by a mecanum strafing out from under it, 101% of the victim's own travel. The
 *      tangential half of a contact is now capped by what the other robot can actually press
 *      with and by the tyres it is pulling against, and a sideways exit along an open wall is
 *      a real escape again (which is why the G422 wall-pin check is now the CORNER);
 *    · AN UNPOWERED ROBOT NO LONGER BRAKES AGAINST A SHOVE at full stopping authority
 *      (`MOTOR_SHOVE_BRAKE`) — three seconds of full throttle moved an idle equal chassis
 *      15.5in, now 95in.

 *   · a pile ALREADY resting on the perimeter cannot go anywhere, so driving into it is

 * IT HAS TO BE DISTANCE, NOT SPEED. An instantaneous-speed floor was tried first and does not

 * itself — the artifact is no longer where you found it, by its own width. Compression and
 * squirt as a pile settles are well under it; anything you could call herding is well over.
 *
 * This gates ACQUIRING control only. Once herding IS established the latch holds it through a
 * jam, so driving a pile INTO the wall and leaning on it still counts — those artifacts
 * travelled on the way there. That split is the whole of the leniency: running into things is
 * free, taking them somewhere is not.

 *    floor. Nothing extra is applied, because shoving the column back UP the ramp is the
 *    one thing that solver refuses to do.)
 *  · d < 0 — the artifact is already mostly THROUGH. The paddle is on its uphill face and
 *    the same weight bears down-ramp: GATE_PADDLE_SHOVE is that component, and the arm
 *    squeezes the artifact out from under itself and falls shut behind it, unassisted.
