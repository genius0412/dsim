/**
 * App branding + the SEASON registry.
 *
 * The product is **DohunSim** — a 2D FTC driver-practice simulator. Each FTC
 * game is a "season". Right now only DECODE (2025–26) is playable; the sim's
 * geometry/scoring in `src/config.ts` + `src/sim/` are DECODE-specific. This
 * module is the seam for adding future seasons: register another `Season` here,
 * flip `playable: true` once its rules land, and the UI (season badge/picker)
 * picks it up automatically. Keep the APP name ("DohunSim") separate from the
 * SEASON name ("DECODE") everywhere in the UI — the brand is the app, DECODE is
 * just the game currently loaded.
