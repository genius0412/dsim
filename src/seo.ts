 * React is up, for the crawlers that DO render (Googlebot) and for the browser
 * tab. The home entry below must stay in sync with the static tags in
 * `index.html`; everything else only exists here.
 *
 * Canonical URLs matter more than usual here: `/`, `/decode` and any legacy
 * unprefixed path (`/leaderboard`, `/my-robot`, …) all resolve to the same
 * screen, and the router rewrites the address bar on load. Without an explicit
 * canonical, search engines would see several URLs serving one page.
