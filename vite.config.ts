    // you are approved — so with `VITE_ADSENSE_CLIENT` set and no slots, nothing
    // whatsoever appears on the page and there is nothing for Google to find.
    //
    // This meta tag is Google's own no-ads verification method, and it is the
    // right one here: it proves ownership without pulling a third-party script
    // into a 60 Hz game for zero user benefit. Together with the generated
