# HANDOFF — 2026-07-08 (session 7: intake/ball feel + seasons + multi-server) — READ FIRST

## Branch strategy (IMPORTANT — this session introduced a two-branch split)
- **`alpha`** = the primary dev line: physics/ball tuning **plus** the new backend features.
- **`beta`** = **`main` + the backend features only, NO physics** (per user). Branched fresh
  off `main` this session (old beta was a stale ancestor; force-moved to `main`).
- The backend feature commits are authored on `beta`, then **cherry-picked onto `alpha`**
  (feature files — `server/*`, `src/net/*`, `src/ui/*` — are disjoint from the physics files
  `config.ts`/`goal.ts`/`robot.ts`, so cherry-picks are clean).
- `main` is untouched this session. Nothing pushed yet (`git push` when ready).

## Build state
- **`alpha`**: GREEN — `npm test` ALL PASS, `npm run build` clean, `npm run server:check` clean.
- **`beta`**: GREEN — same three all pass (after the tank-NaN guard below).

## alpha ≠ main on the TANK drivetrain (gotcha)
`alpha` and `main` **diverged** on tank drive. `main` merged a "tank" PR that added required
`leftDrive`/`rightDrive` to `RobotCommand` and an independent-stick tank model — but left two
bugs: server `ZERO_CMD` missing those fields (server:check red) and `(undefined+undefined)/2`
= NaN on a driver-frame strafe (smoke red). `alpha` never took that PR (its own drivetrain
overhaul has no `leftDrive`/`rightDrive`). On `beta` both were fixed (ZERO_CMD fields;
`cmd.leftDrive ?? 0`). Do NOT assume alpha and main share tank code.

## What shipped this session

### 1. Ball/intake feel (ALPHA ONLY — `config.ts`/`goal.ts`/`robot.ts`)
- **Goal basin**: split funnel velocity into radial+tangential and damp the tangential hard
  (`BASIN_TANGENT_DAMPING`) so balls spiral STRAIGHT into the classifier throat instead of
  orbiting it (the "circular jumble"); brisker funnel (`BASIN_FUNNEL_ACCEL` 500→700, grip
  260, entry-keep 0.45).
- **Gate release**: `TUNNEL_EXIT_VEL.along` 42→22 (gentle) with independent x/y jitter (0.6–1.4)
  — low momentum + friction + ball↔ball spread the drain. Earlier a symmetric perpendicular
  kick split it into TWO branches; removed. Overflow flow speed untouched (58).
- **Triangle intake**: strongest grab (`drawIn` 28→46, `capMin/Max` 0.04/0.07, clump 0.035).
  Tradeoff stays TRANSFER (`fireCap`), not the grab.
- **Vector intake**: no clump SPEED bonus (that's a wedge trait now — gated on `m.wedge`). A
  FLAT intake rammed into an OFF-CENTER ball at high CLOSING speed (`INTAKE_RAM_SPEED` 32,
  measured RELATIVE to the robot) is NOT vectored — it bounces off the flat front as a normal
  impact collision (`collideBallRobot`). Impact-only: once a ball rides with the chassis (low
  closing speed) it vectors in even while pushing hard; the CENTER compliant wheels always
  intake fast.

### 2. Feature A — Seasons (BOTH branches)
Season = the `balance_version` key, but the LIVE season is now DB-controlled so an admin can
start a fresh season at runtime without a redeploy.
- `server/db/repo.ts`: `currentSeasonNumber(fallback)` = max(highest `seasons` row, config
  `BALANCE_VERSION`); `listSeasons()`, `startNewSeason(name)`, `purgeSeasonReplays(season)`.
- Migration `0004_season_replay_index.sql`: index `replays.balance_version` for bulk purge.
- `persist.ts`: stamps results AND the replay with `currentSeasonNumber` (identical to before
  until an admin advances the season).
- API: `GET /api/seasons` (list + `current`); default board view = live season. Admin
  `POST /api/admin/season/start` + `/purge-replays` (JWT admin id OR `ADMIN_SECRET`).
- Client: **season picker** in `Leaderboard.tsx` (archived seasons stay viewable; wires the
  already-supported `season` param); Admin buttons "Start new season" + "Purge archived
  replays". Purge deletes replays only — `records/matches.replay_id` are `on delete set null`,
  so boards survive and just lose watchability.

### 3. Feature B — Multi-server (BOTH branches) — partial
- `src/net/env.ts`: game server is now a **list** (`VITE_GAME_SERVERS` JSON of
  `{id,label,region,url}`), back-compat to single `VITE_GAME_SERVER_URL`. A module-level
  SELECTED server drives `gameServerUrl()/gameServerHttpUrl()`, so all existing connect sites
  follow the choice with no change. `multiServer()`, `setSelectedServer(id)`, `httpOf()`.
- `src/net/ping.ts`: pre-connection latency probe (`pingServer`/`pingAll`/`pingQuality`/
  `fastestServer`) timing each server's `/health`. `/health` now sends CORS + `x-region`
  (from `FLY_REGION`/`SERVER_REGION`); `/api/presence` reports its region.
- **Record-run server picker** (`src/ui/ServerPicker.tsx`, wired in `RecordRun.tsx`): when
  >1 server is configured, the player picks a region from a live ping list before starting;
  single-server deploys skip it. Choice is **saved to the account** via
  `GameSettings.preferredServerId` (synced through the existing account-settings sync — NOT
  localStorage) and restored on load (App effect on `settings.preferredServerId`).
- `.env.example` documents `VITE_GAME_SERVERS`.

## NEXT UP (where I stopped — matchmaking regions)
Multiplayer cross-region matchmaking is **not done**. Chosen design (confirmed approach):
**region-aware matchmaking — cross-region by default + a region-lock filter.** Plan:
1. `protocol.ts` `queue` msg: add `region?: string` + `regionLock?: boolean` (I started this
   edit then reverted it to keep the tree clean — re-apply it).
2. `server/matchmaking.ts`: `QueueEntry` gains `region`/`regionLock`; replace the FIFO
   `splice(0, need)` with a `findGroup` that only pairs a region-locked player with same-region
   players (unlocked = cross-region). Add a smoke test for the pairing rule.
3. `server/index.ts` queue handler: pass `region`/`regionLock` from the msg to `enqueue`.
4. `src/net/lobbyClient.ts` `queue()` + `src/ui/Matchmaking.tsx`: a region-lock toggle; send
   the selected server's region.
- **Cross-INSTANCE matchmaking** (matching players on physically different Fly regions) needs
  SHARED queue state (the matchmaker is in-process per instance). Deferred: either route all
  ranked to ONE matchmaking instance (config/deploy choice), or a Postgres-backed shared queue.
  Document the deploy choice; don't build speculative shared-queue infra until multi-region Fly
  is actually provisioned.
- **Fly multi-region provisioning** needs the user's `flyctl`/account: `fly regions add <code>`,
  set `VITE_GAME_SERVERS` on Vercel to the per-region wss:// URLs. Not doable from here.

## Gotchas / how to work here
- **Two-branch flow**: author backend features on `beta`, `git cherry-pick <sha>` onto `alpha`.
  Verify BOTH: `npm run server:check`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.
- PowerShell: no `&&`; here-strings for commit messages must use single-quoted `@'…'@` and the
  closing `'@` at column 0. Avoid inner double-quotes in the message body (they broke a commit).
- Season model: reads default to the LIVE season (may be admin-advanced past config
  `BALANCE_VERSION`); an explicit `?season=` picks an archived one. `replays.balance_version`
  is stamped with the season so a purge is a direct delete-by-season.
- Deploy protocol (unchanged): commit on alpha → merge main → `flyctl deploy --remote-only`
  (`dohun-sim-decode`) → verify `/health` → Vercel auto-deploys the client. `docs/deploy.md`.
- No Co-Authored-By / Claude trailer on commits (user preference).
