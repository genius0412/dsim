# Deploy the DECODE game server to Fly, then RE-APPLY the per-region VM sizes.
#
# Why this wrapper exists: `fly deploy` re-applies fly.toml's single `[[vm]]`
# (shared-cpu-4x) to EVERY machine, which resets the cheaper satellite regions.
# fly.toml has no way to express per-region VM sizes, so we shrink the satellites
# back here. ALWAYS deploy via this script, not a bare `fly deploy`.
#
# Sizing policy: iad (matchmaker + always-warm primary) runs shared-cpu-4x (from
# fly.toml — 4 shared vCPUs, ample headroom for the 60Hz loop without a dedicated
# vCPU's cost). EVERY other region, INCLUDING sjc, runs shared-cpu-1x — much cheaper,
# but SHARED: a sustained match there can burn burst
# credits and throttle the 60Hz loop (the flap risk fly.toml warns about). They rarely
# host a match and auto-stop when idle, so the cost win outweighs it; bump back to a
# performance-* size if a far region starts flapping under real matches. Tune below.
#
# ALPHA: `./scripts/fly-deploy.sh --alpha` deploys the PREVIEW app from fly.alpha.toml
# instead — one region, its own database, and no satellites to re-shrink. The two are kept
# in one script on purpose: a second script is a second thing to forget to update, and the
# only real difference is which config file and which app name.

# THE FLEET, DECLARED. This line is the in-repo source of truth for which regions run
# a machine, and `npm run test:mm` asserts that server/regions.ts agrees with it.
#
# It exists because the two drifted and the failure was silent: `ord`, `gru` and `jnb`
# all had live machines while `DEPLOY_REGIONS` still listed five regions, and
# `interRegionMs` answers a RADIUS_MAX-sized penalty for any region it has no row for.
# So a player whose Anycast landing region was missing did not read as "far" — they read
# as unpairable until the search radius saturated six seconds later, and never at all if
# they had asked to stay region-local. Two players in the same city could not be matched
# to each other. Nothing logs when this happens.
#
# ADD A REGION HERE AND IN server/regions.ts (both DEPLOY_REGIONS and the RTT table) IN
# THE SAME CHANGE. The test fails if this list names a region the code does not know.

# sjc joined this list 2026-07-20 (cost pass): US West is redundant with iad for
# the ~75% of games that are solo record runs, and it auto-stops when idle anyway.
# ⚠️ ord/gru/jnb are deliberately NOT here yet: they sit at 512MB, under the 1024 this
# script's own note says Node+Rapier needs, and adding them to the re-shrink would
# silently change their memory. Size them deliberately, then move them in.

# the script mid-way, silently leaving the satellites on shared-cpu-4x. Observed
# 2026-07-20. So capture the status, ALWAYS re-shrink, and re-raise at the end.
