# Deploy the DECODE game server to Fly, then RE-APPLY the per-region VM sizes.
#
# Why this wrapper exists: `fly deploy` re-applies fly.toml's single `[[vm]]`
# (performance-1x) to EVERY machine, which resets the cheaper satellite regions.
# fly.toml has no way to express per-region VM sizes, so we shrink the satellites
# back here. ALWAYS deploy via this script, not a bare `fly deploy`.
#
# Sizing policy: iad (matchmaker + always-warm primary) and sjc run performance-1x
# (dedicated cpu, from fly.toml). The low-traffic FAR satellites (Europe/Oceania/Asia)
# run shared-cpu-1x — much cheaper, but SHARED: a sustained match there can burn burst
# credits and throttle the 60Hz loop (the flap risk fly.toml warns about). They rarely
# host a match and auto-stop when idle, so the cost win outweighs it; bump back to a
# performance-* size if a far region starts flapping under real matches. Tune below.

APP="${FLY_APP:-dohun-sim-decode}"
# EVERY region except the always-warm primary (iad) runs the cheap shared size.
# sjc joined this list 2026-07-20 (cost pass): US West is redundant with iad for
# the ~75% of games that are solo record runs, and it auto-stops when idle anyway.

# NOTE: do NOT let a non-zero deploy skip the re-shrink below. `fly deploy` exits
# non-zero on transient api.machines.dev flakes (health-check wait timeouts, cancelled
# requests) even when every machine actually updated — and with `set -e` that aborted
# the script mid-way, silently leaving the satellites on dedicated vCPUs. Observed
# 2026-07-20. So capture the status, ALWAYS re-shrink, and re-raise at the end.
